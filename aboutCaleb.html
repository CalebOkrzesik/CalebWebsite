                I am a person who is dedicated and willing to push past my limits to reach my goals. Learning is one of my primary goals which is the pursuit of knowledge. I work well with people, and I would hope most consider me genuinely fun to be around. I am in the 3+1 Program with Lewis University for a Bachelors in CS. I will be graduating with an AAS from College of DuPage in software development. (May 2024) I currently work at Target and have done so for just about 3 years. I have picked up many skills but the most important is communication and the ability to work well with a team.
